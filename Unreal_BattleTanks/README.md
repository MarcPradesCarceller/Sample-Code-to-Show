Battle Tanks
===============

A simple Tanks game deveolped to learn in depth C++ and Unreal during the recovery of a Coccyx (tailbone) fracture.

The game was built from scratch without any template or asset (except for models and graphics). The movement, animations, systems are
all built in C++, with a custom wheel suspension system and a simple seek and destroy AI.
