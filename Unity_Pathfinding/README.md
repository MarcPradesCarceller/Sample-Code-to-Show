Custom A* Pathfinding
===============
A custom weighed grid based, multithreaded A* Pathfinding solution, develop for Unity using C# to an AI class project in 2017.

The grid is auto-generated, with the ability of being able to fine tune its vaules and being visualized used Gizmos if the user wants.
The weighed are calculated using collision layers and uses a convolution matrix to blend them, the result is a more human-like behavior
when findingh paths, instead of a more robotic optimal one.

The pathfinding uses the A* method, multithreathing and a custom Heap for runtime optimization.
