VR Voxels
===============

A Fully develop VR shooting game where the player tries to fight across 50 hand-crafted levels and waves of retro alien enemies.
The game contains 50 different levels, in wich one consits on 4 waves of enemies. The waves and the enemies have been hand-crafted,
blanced, and tested to give the player fun, engagement and challenge without frustration.

The game has a Space Invaders retro asthetic using voxels. The player can save his progress every 5 levels and resume the game where he
left it, as well as choose any level to train.

The project has been architectured to offer a flexible and modular code using Scriptable Objects in order to achieve a hig level of
fexibility, and easy customization of the levels, waves, enemies, power-ups, weapons... It also is otimized by using different custom
Pooling systems and reducing the number of MonoBehaviours and Updates in the game.

There is only a small part of the code due to an NDA. *For more information contact with me.*
